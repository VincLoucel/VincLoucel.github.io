--Introduction, police normal, 
Today, wherever there is a business, there is data behind it. Understanding this data can be a daunting task, especially for those who are not well-versed in data analysis. This is where data visualization comes into play.

What is Data Visualization?

-- En dessous, citation, italique
“A picture is worth a thousand words.” - Confucius

This adage captures the essence of data visualization. Data visualization is the transformation of information into a visual format, such as a bar chart, pie chart, or color-coded sequence of numbers. Its purpose is to allow humans to quickly grasp the main information being communicated, bypassing the need for tedious sentences or large Excel tables. A good data visualization addresses a business problem almost instantly.

A Quick Example:

-- En dessous, texte normal
Imagine you run a sales company and you want to know if this month's sales have improved compared to the previous month or the same month last year. What’s the simplest way to get this information? Should you sift through your spreadsheet, or simply look at a timeline graph of your monthly sales?
Below is an example of a table and its corresponding graph:

Which method helps you understand the trend more quickly? The graph likely gives you a more immediate and clear understanding of your sales performance. And indeed,  Scientific studies show that human eyes process visuals 60,000 times faster than text

How to Create the Best Data Visualization Dashboards?

-- En dessous, texte normal
Many excellent tools are available for data visualization, with Tableau, Qlik, and PowerBI being among the most popular. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but regardless of the tool, some principles remain constant for effective data visualization.

1.   Data model is the key

-- En dessous, texte normal 
I can not talk about data vizualisation without talking about data modeling. After all, how can someone build a house without strong walls ? The analogy can seem a little bit  cheesy, it is nonetheless true. And of course, the wall had to be adapted to the house you are building?
Consider these three points when developing your data model:

- Granularity: Is the granularity of your data appropriate for what you want to show?
- Clarity: Can you easily explain any number displayed on your dashboard?
- Performance: Is the data load manageable for your tool? If not, what can you do to improve it?
If you address these points, you will have a solid foundation for your visualizations.

2.   Keep it simple

-- EN dessous, texte normal 
How we like to control everything. To have everything we want at the tips of our hand. After all, why not have 30 vizualisations with a total of 180 KPIs shown in only one dashboard ? But consider this : overloading a dashboard can slow down its performance and overwhelm the user. Here what you can always keep in mind constructing your dashboards
- The more visualizations you add, the slower the dashboard will be. Do you know how frustrating it is to have to wait 5 minutes before your graph show up ? Try to reduce to the minimum the number of vizualisation and KPI by dashboard. One dashboard should address one business problematic, that should be adressed by the less KPIs and graph possible. Furthermore, too much information can cause stakeholders to lose interest.
- The more calculation (especially complex calculation) made with the tool, again, the slower it will be. It is really true id you try to mix multiples granularities in the same graphs or sheet (I see you Tableau LOD). Then it can really become a nightmare.
Complex calculations should be handled in the data model, not within the dashboard tool. Document these calculations clearly, and use tooltips to explain how values are derived.

3.  Understand the business need

AI is making the modern data stack even more relevant. Almost all data and tech companies are integrating AI into their tools, enhancing capabilities across the board.

AI in Data Visualization

--En dessous, texte normal
And here comes our third point. This is perhaps the most important point. A data vizualition is not here to (only) play pretty. It should serve a business need, making life easier for the end user, not harder. Without a clear business purpose, a data visualization is pointless. When the business need is not well understood, dashboards can become cluttered with unnecessary visualizations and information. It may seem logical, even obvious, but I've seen many data viz created without a clear view of what was the problem. And the result had never last more than 3 months. Always start with a clear understanding of the problem you are trying to solve.

Final Thoughts

--En dessous, texte normal
Data visualization is not magic, but when built on a solid foundation with a clear vision, it can significantly enhance the value of your work. Always keep in mind why you are creating dashboards and use them wisely.
